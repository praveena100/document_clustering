Document Clustering - Grouping Documents Based on Content
________________________________________
1. Project Overview
Introduction
This project focuses on document clustering, which automatically groups documents based on their content similarity. It uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to categorize documents into meaningful clusters, enabling efficient document organization and retrieval.
Problem Statement
In many organizations, large volumes of text data exist in an unstructured format, making information retrieval difficult. This project aims to address this issue by providing:
•	Automated document grouping based on textual content.
•	Topic-based categorization for easy organization.
•	Efficient search and retrieval of documents using clusters.
•	Improved knowledge management by identifying hidden patterns in text data.
Dataset Used
This project can be implemented using publicly available text datasets, such as:
•	20 Newsgroups Dataset (A collection of news articles categorized into 20 topics).
•	Reuters-21578 Dataset (A collection of Reuters news articles categorized into 90 classes).
•	Custom datasets (e.g., company reports, research papers, etc.).

2. Implementation Details
Methodology & Approach
1.	Preprocessing of Text Data
o	Tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization.
o	Vectorization using TF-IDF or Word Embeddings.
2.	Feature Extraction
o	Converting text data into numerical format using TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or BERT embeddings.
3.	Clustering Algorithm
o	K-Means Clustering: Assigns documents into k clusters.
o	Hierarchical Clustering: Builds a tree of clusters.
o	DBSCAN: Finds clusters of varying densities.
4.	Evaluation Metrics
o	Silhouette Score (to measure clustering effectiveness).
o	Purity Score (to evaluate cluster quality).
o	Topic Coherence (for topic modeling-based approaches).
